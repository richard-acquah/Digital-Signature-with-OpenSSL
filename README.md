# Digital Signature with OpenSSL.
## Objectives
This lab seeks to demonstrate how digital signatures can be generated and used to sign documents. The lab focuses on using Cisco's Skills for all derivatives of Ubuntu Linux to generate private and public keys and use the private key to digitally sign a document.
## Skill Learned
+ Application of digital signature.
## Resources / Tools /Utilities
+ Cisco's CSE-LABVM VM(Ubuntu derivative)
+ Open SSL
## Steps
To generate a private key, open the terminal and enter the command: ***openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private_key.pem***:
